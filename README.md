<p align="left">Building a Data Labeling Platform for Web3 use cases involves creating a system where users can perform crowdsourced tasks and receive crypto payments, specifically utilizing Solana for transactions. Key components include secure user-uploaded content with pre-signed URLs on AWS S3, ensuring data integrity and privacy. The platform integrates SCALE AI's quality assurance mechanisms for reliable and consistent annotated datasets, leveraging advanced technologies like machine learning and automation to optimize efficiency. Features include a robust backend design, database schema for task management, JWT-based authentication, and secure private key management on EC2. The system ensures accurate worker payments and task labeling, addressing transaction vulnerabilities and double spending risks, while promoting the benefits of a global currency via Web3.. provide Additional Notes</p>
